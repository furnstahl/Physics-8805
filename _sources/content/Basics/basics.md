# Basics of Bayesian statistics

We will start by putting on the table some basic Bayesian concepts and features of Bayesian statistics.

Good references for this material that are particularly physicist-friendly are Chapters 1 and 2 Sivia {cite}`Sivia2006`; Chapter 1 from Gregory {cite}`Gregory:2005`; and the article by Trotta {cite}`Trotta:2008qt`.

The examples in Sivia have been implemented in Jupyter notebooks that you will work through as we proceed. You are highly encouraged to answer the questions in the notebooks, play with different values for the parameters, and extend the examples (you will be guided to do so in some cases).
