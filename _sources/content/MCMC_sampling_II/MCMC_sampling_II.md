# MCMC Sampling II

In this section we explore more details of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in particular, using PyMC3 as an HMC implementation. 

Good references for HMC include ["Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Explained"](https://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/12/19/markov_chain_monte_carlo.html) by Alex Rogozhnikov and ["MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1901) by Radford Neal.
