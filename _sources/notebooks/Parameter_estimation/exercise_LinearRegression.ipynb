    "1. In principle, gradient descent works well for convex cost functions, i.e. where the gradient will eventually direct you to the position of the global minimum. Again, the linear regression problem is favorable because you can show that the cost function has that property. However, most cost functions---in particular in many dimensions---correspond to very **complicated surfaces with many local minima**. In those cases, gradient descent is often not a good method."
