    "* Define a function for the exact result plus noise, noting from the arXiv paper what type of noise is added and where the points are located (i.e., what values of $x$). \n",
    "* Define functions for the two choices of prior and for the likelihood. Also a function for the posterior.\n",
    "* Call emcee to sample the posteriors.\n",
    "* Use corner to create plots.  You can read the answers for the tables from the corner plots (it is also possible to extract the numbers directly: see the example at the bottom of [this page](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/line/) from the emcee documentation).\n",
    "* Don't try to do too much in your code at first (start with the lowest order in Table III). \n",
    "* Fill in the rest of Table III.  Characterize and explain the different results from the two priors (also: which one is equivalent to standard least-squares fitting?).  \n",
    "* Generate figures for the lowest orders analogous to Figure 1 and then reproduce Figure 1.  Interpret the projected posteriors (e.g., what coefficients are very correlated and how does this relate to overfitting?) and identify where the \"prior is returned\". \n"

    "### Comments and suggestions\n",
    "* To reproduce precisely (within fluctuations from the sampling) the numbers in Table III, you'll need to use the same data set used in the table.  This is available from the arXiv as [D1_c_5.dat](https://arxiv.org/src/1511.03618v3/anc/D1_c_5.dat).  These values are those plotted in the figure at the top of this notebook.\n",
    "* The 5% error is a *relative* error, meaning it is 0.05 times the data at that point.  This means if you generate a Gaussian random number `err` distributed with standard deviation 0.05, the value of sigma for the log likelihood is `sigma[i] = data[i] * err` (use the data, not the theory at `i`).\n",
    "* The `show_titles=True` option to corner will show central results and one-$\\sigma$ error limits on the projected posterior plots.\n",
    "* The `quantiles=[0.16, 0.5, 0.84]`option to corner adds the dashed vertical lines to the marginal posteriors on the diagonal. You can obviously change the quantiles if you want another credibility region.\n",
    "* The Python command `np.percentile(samples, [16, 50, 84],axis=0)` might be useful to extract numerical values for the credibility region and the mean from a python array `samples`of shape (nsamples,ndimensions).\n",
    "* The example on [Fitting a Model to Data](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/v2.2.1/user/line/) from the emcee documentation may be useful to supplement the examples in the other notebooks.\n",
    "* Defining Python functions to do the sampling and plotting will make it much more efficient (and easier) to generate the numbers in the table or the particular plots for figure 1."
